## Overview
This repository contains the configuration and scripts to manage the CI/CD pipelines for a cloud-native FinTech application. The pipelines are designed to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for microservices and predictive models.

## Master Pipeline: `master-pipelines`

![MASTER_ORCHESTRATION drawio(2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7efd334-ee7e-4ebc-ac00-b68016e15980)

The `master-pipelines` job orchestrates the CI/CD pipelines for all microservices and machine learning models. Each job within the pipeline consists of the following stages:

### **Pipeline Stages**
1. **Checkout**
   - Retrieves the source code from the Git repository.
   - Ensures the pipeline uses the latest version of the code.

2. **Build**
   - Compiles the source code for the respective service or model.
   - Verifies successful compilation before proceeding.

3. **Test**
   - Executes unit and integration tests.
   - Ensures code correctness and stability.

4. **SonarQube Analysis**
   - Runs static code analysis using SonarQube.
   - Displays detailed code quality reports (e.g., code smells, vulnerabilities, coverage).

5. **Build Docker Image**
   - Creates a Docker image for the service or model.
   - Tags the image with the appropriate version.

6. **Push Image to ECR**
   - Pushes the Docker image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
   - Ensures the image is ready for deployment.

7. **Deploy Image to EKS**
   - Deploys the Docker image to an AWS EKS cluster.
   - Uses Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts for deployment.

8. **Cleanup Images from Local**
   - Removes local Docker images to free up disk space.

## Features
- **Orchestration**: The `master-pipelines` job coordinates all services and models, ensuring seamless integration.
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Provides detailed SonarQube reports to maintain high standards.
- **Artifact Management**: Docker images are built, tagged, and stored in AWS ECR.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Services and models are deployed to Kubernetes (AWS EKS), ensuring scalability and reliability.
- **Pipeline Visualization**: Displays real-time progress and logs for each stage in the pipeline.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Jenkins  setup.
- Access to AWS ECR and EKS.
- SonarQube server configured for static code analysis.

### Running the Pipeline
1. Trigger the `master-pipelines` job from the CI/CD tool.
2. Monitor the progress through the pipeline dashboard.
3. Review SonarQube reports for code quality.
4. Verify deployment status in AWS EKS.

## Visualizations

### **SonarQube Reports**
- Accessible through the pipeline dashboard or SonarQube server.
- Key metrics:
  - Code coverage
  - Bugs and vulnerabilities
  - Code smells
